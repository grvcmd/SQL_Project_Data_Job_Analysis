# Background
Ths project was born from a desire to learn about the top-paid and in-demand skills in order to streamline finding optimal jobs.

The data comes from a larger dataset of real-world data science job postings from 2023, which was posted by Luke Barousse.

### The questions I wanted to answer through my SQL queries were: 
1. What are the top-paying data analyst jobs?
2. What skills are required for these top-paying jobs?
3. What skills are most in demand for data analysts?
4. Which skills are associated with higher salaries?
5. What are the most optimal skills to learn?
# Tools I Used
For  my deep dive into the data analyst job market, I used the following key tools:

- **SQL**: The main component of my analysis, allowing me to query the database and discover important insights.
- **PostgreSQL**: The chosen database management system, ideal for handling the job posting data.
- **Visual Studio Code**: My go-to for database management and executing SQL queries
- **Git & Github**: Essential for version control and sharing my SQL scripts and analysis, ensuring collaboration and project tracking.
# The Analysis
Each query in this project aims to investigate certain aspects of the data analyst job market.
Here's how I approached each question:

### 1. Top Paying Data Analyst Jobs in Texas
To identify the highest-paying roles, I filtered data analyst positions by average yearly salary and location, focusing on Texas or remote jobs. This query highlights the high paying opportunities in the field.

    job_posted_date,
    company_dim.name AS company_name
FROM
    job_postings_fact
LEFT JOIN company_dim ON job_postings_fact.company_id = company_dim.company_id
WHERE 
    job_title_short = 'Data Analyst' AND
    (job_location = 'Texas' OR job_location = 'Anywhere') AND
    salary_year_avg IS NOT NULL
ORDER BY 
    salary_year_avg DESC
LIMIT 10;
```
